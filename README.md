# Blind-Image-Separation
This project was developed for the course of Deep Learning at the University of Bologna.

## Problem statement
Blind source separation task requires separating different signals from a set of mixed ones, in our case we consider superimposed images taken from [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and [FASHION MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist) datasets.
